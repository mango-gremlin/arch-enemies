# Coding conventions:
In our project we are coding with around 10 ppl at the time.
This amount requires **rules and conventions** to comply to in order to:
- write code that anyone can use or adapt
- have a readable codebase that does not change naming schemes too often
- make it easy to interact with the code written by others because they follow **the same principles**
