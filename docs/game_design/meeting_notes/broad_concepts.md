## Gameplay Loop
- **Exploring phase:** conserve HP/Morale, collect resources during puzzles/combat
- **Bridging phase:** Series of bridge puzzles + combat encounters, spend card resources (effectively a Boss with heavy focus on managing resources)
- **Planning phase:** Spend resources as gifts to factions (unlock new cards), build your deck

## Deck Building
- $x$ animals in deck, $x$ increases with game progression
- each animals has 2-4 associated cards
	- 1 generic (e.g. swipe, bite)
	- 1 unique (e.g. wolfs' howl)
	- 1 semi-unique (e.g. pack tactics)

## Exploration
- Smaller combat/puzzles, without specified order
- rewards
	- resources
		- single use items (combat/bridge)
		- permanent resource (gifts to factions -> new cards)
	- morale victory: recruit enemies
	- physical victory: **???** (replenishment, resources, card capacity?)
## Combat
- Asymmetrical: Player has cards, Enemy creature has simple cyclical attacks
- Both player and enemy have an HP and Moral bar, can be damage separate, if either is 0, they lose (player defeat -> last save/planning phase)
- cards
	- each card has 2 modes each: physical and moral (potentially different strength)
	- each card has a type (i.e. mammalian), can interact with card abilities
	- card role is designated by small symbol
## Bridging
- Player Character (Fox?) needs to get from side A to side B
- Player can run and jump but cannot fall into water
- use animal-allies to form a bridge that Player can walk on and jump across
- Animal Mechanics:
	- spider can stick to all surfaces (also upside down)
- Environmental Mechanics:
	- different environments in different areas
   	- geyser that shoots you up, blocking one geyser makes other geyser stronger
   	- vines with swinging platforms, vines for climbing up
   	- watermill that turns
- success when Player stands on other side
- (repeat player-path with other animal sprites to show your allies following you?)

- If an animal is used, their associated cards will be exhausted, significantly weakening them
	- Can be undone by spending resources and at the end of each level
