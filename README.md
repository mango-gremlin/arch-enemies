Arch Enemies is a bridge building puzzle game where a fox tries to bridge the differences of the animals in the forest to save their home from invasive species. It involves convincing other animals to join your cause and building bridges by using your allies to cross a flooded forest.

## Overview:
This repository represents the work done by 10 students aiming to program their first game using GODOT.
It allows for insights of struggles that we've had throughout development and will hopefully contain a playable game at the end of this semester (early 2024).

## Structure: 
Everything regarding **concepts**, **ideas** or **protocols**, information on Game Design and Implementation, as well as more details for the game's story, see [the Wiki](https://github.com/mango-gremlin/arch-enemies/wiki) or [the docs](/docs/).

## How to run the game
Find our most recent release [here](https://github.com/mango-gremlin/arch-enemies/releases) - it should contain an .exe file you can download and play on your computer. 
If you don't own a windows device or do not want to download questionable executables from github, you can find the game on [itch]().
