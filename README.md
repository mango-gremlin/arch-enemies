# Arch Enemies | because fighting is harmful

![bridge-scene_biig](https://github.com/mango-gremlin/arch-enemies/assets/104830903/ee446310-3af2-4f7d-b8e7-890c921c138f)

Arch Enemies is a bridge building puzzle game where a fox tries to bridge the differences of the animals in the forest to save their home from invasive species. It involves convincing other animals to join your cause and building bridges by using your allies to cross a flooded forest.

This repository represents the work done by 10 students aiming to program their first game using GODOT as part of a game jam with the Theme "Troubled Waters".

It allows for insights of struggles that we've had throughout development and now, at the end of the semester, contains a playable demo-game!

This game was developed for a course which is now over. We will not be working on the game for now, but we might come back to it later when we have time.

## The Game
Arch Enemies came to be as part of a university practical course. This course was set up like a game jam, where the aim is to build a game following a theme.

The theme was "troubled waters". Our game interprets this theme in two ways: In the game the forest was flooded due to a storm, so there are literal troubled waters. But there is also conflict between the animals, instigated by the frogs who want to take over the forest after the flood, so figuratively, the waters are troubled as well.

The goal of the game is to build literal bridges to cross the flooded forest using the allies the fox (= the player) has gathered in their travels, and solving the conflict between the animals, thus rebuilding the relational bridges between the animals.

For more information on the story and the thoughts behind gameplay elements, see [the Wiki](https://github.com/mango-gremlin/arch-enemies/wiki).

## Story

![cutscene_1_v2_2_big](https://github.com/mango-gremlin/arch-enemies/assets/104830903/f2d847e7-fbb3-4cf6-9f0a-3d1eedc1b227)

The story centres around the fox - the protagonist - who is trying to find the cause of the beavers' sickness that led the dam to fail and caused the forest flood. On their journey, they will encounter friends and enemies alike. 

The devious frogs led by Toadally Anonymous, who is toa(d)tally not a frog or anything will stop at nothing to sow discord among the forest animals to stop the fox from finding out truth and saving the forest.

Since the forest was flooded, the other animals can't agree on what to do, which is exacerbated by the frogs' meddling and the fact that they can't find food due to the flood.

Will the fox be able to bring the animals together and save the forest, or will the invasive frog species prevail? Only one way to find out!
