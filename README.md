## Overview:
This repository represents the work done by 10 students aiming to programm their first game using GODOT.
It allows for insights of struggles that we've had throughout development and will hopefully contain a playable game at the end of this semester (early 2024).

## Structure: 

Everything regarding **concepts**, **ideas** or **protocols** is to be found in [the docs](/docs/)
For more information on Game Design and Implementation (?) see [the Wiki](https://github.com/mango-gremlin/arch-enemies/wiki)
